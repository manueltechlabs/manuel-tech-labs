# Java Blog Project: Full-Stack Portfolio Website with Dynamic Blog Functionality

## 🌐 Live Demo
[View Live Project](https://bytebounty.com) 

## GitHub Repository
[GitHub - Java Blog Project](https://github.com/manueltechlabs/java-blog-project)

## Overview
This project showcases a professional portfolio website integrated with a **fully dynamic blog system** built using modern Java enterprise technologies. While the main site (Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, Contact) provides a static yet responsive presentation of my work, the blog functions as a **full CRUD web application**, enabling content creation, user interaction, and secure administration.

The backend is powered by **Spring Boot** with **JPA/Hibernate** for ORM, **MySQL** for data persistence, and **Spring Security** for robust authentication and role-based authorization. The frontend uses **Thymeleaf** for server-side rendering, **Bootstrap 5** for responsive design, and enhanced UX tools like **Summernote (WYSIWYG editor)**, **Prism.js (syntax highlighting)**, and **jQuery**.

Deployment is containerized using **Docker** and hosted on **AWS EC2**, ensuring scalability and environment consistency.

## Key Features

### ✅ Dynamic Blog System
- Paginated blog post grid with thumbnails, titles, dates, categories, and tags.
- Clean URL routing using **post slugs** (e.g., `/blog/java-spring-boot-intro`).
- Full-text post view with syntax-highlighted code blocks and embedded media.
- Filter posts by **category** or **tag** via interactive UI.

### User Engagement
- Comment system allowing:
  - Registered users to comment after login.
  - Guests to comment with name and email.
- Reply functionality for threaded discussions.
- Edit and delete own comments (with session validation).
- Admin moderation capabilities.

### Secure Authentication
- Role-based access control: **Admin, Editor, Author, Subscriber**.
- Hierarchical permissions (e.g., Admin inherits all lower roles).
- Login, logout, registration, and "Remember Me" functionality.
- "Forgot Password" flow with email reset token.
- Custom `LoginSuccessHandler` to track last login time.

### User Profiles
- Edit personal information (name, bio, social links).
- Upload and manage profile picture.
- View own posts and comments.

### 🖋️ Rich Content Management
- WYSIWYG editor (**Summernote**) for creating and editing blog posts.
- Support for:
  - Text formatting (bold, italic, lists, headings).
  - Image uploads with server-side storage.
  - Code block embedding with **Prism.js** highlighting.
- Draft saving and scheduled publishing.

### 🛠️ Admin Dashboard

## UI/UX Design
Leveraged premium-quality templates from [HTMLCodex.com](https://htmlcodex.com):
- **FreeFolio** – For the personal portfolio layout.
- **Bloggy** – For blog structure and styling.

These templates were customized to ensure visual consistency across the static portfolio and dynamic blog, creating a seamless user experience.

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|--------|--------|
| Summernote image upload conflicts | Implemented custom file upload handler with UUID-named files and session-safe deletion logic |
| Role hierarchy in Spring Security | Used `RoleHierarchyImpl` to define parent-child role relationships |
| CSRF protection with Thymeleaf forms | Integrated `th:action` with Spring’s CSRF token auto-inclusion |
| Secure credential storage | Used Docker secrets mounted as files, not environment variables |

## Future Improvements
- Email notifications for new comments (via JavaMail).
- Newsletter subscription system with confirmation workflow.
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Orchestration with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
- Admin dashboard SPA using React/Vue for better UX.
