# TheLook eCommerce: Interactive Performance Dashboards
This project presents a suite of four interactive Tableau dashboards built to visualize key performance metrics for The Look eCommerce, a synthetic dataset by Google’s Looker team. Designed as a companion to a Python/SQL analysis, these dashboards transform complex operational data into intuitive, actionable insights for business stakeholders.

## Design & Impact
Each dashboard is interactive, filterable by time, category, and region, enabling drill-down exploration. Clean layouts, consistent color schemes, and clear labeling ensure accessibility for non-technical users.

The dashboards support strategic decision-making by:

- Highlighting seasonal demand patterns for targeted campaigns
- Exposing checkout friction points to reduce cart abandonment
- Monitoring supply chain reliability to improve fulfillment
- Visualizing category-level profitability for inventory planning 

Linked to the Colab-based analytical backend, this project bridges deep data analysis with executive-ready visualization—demonstrating end-to-end data storytelling and business impact.
