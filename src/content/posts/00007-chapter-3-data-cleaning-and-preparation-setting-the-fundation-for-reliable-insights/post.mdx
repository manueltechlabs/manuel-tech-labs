# Chapter 3: Data Cleaning & Preparation — Setting the Foundation for Reliable Insights

Welcome back to Performance Metrics and Insights: A Data-Driven Analysis of TheLook. In the [second chapter](https://manueltechlabs.com/posts/exploring-the-thelook-ecommerce-database-a-data-analysts-first-steps/), we explored the tables of the database one by one using SQL to understand the context and the interrelation amond them as a pro datata analyst would do. Before diving into KPIs, we need clean, trustworthy data. In this post, I walk through how I prepared TheLook eCommerce dataset for analysis—spotting missing values, checking duplicates, and ensuring data integrity.

## 1. Handling Missing Values
I began by auditing the products and orders tables.

### Products Table

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
  SUM(CASE WHEN cost IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_cost,
  SUM(CASE WHEN category IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_category,
  SUM(CASE WHEN name IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.products`;
```

| total_rows | missing_cost | missing_category | missing_name |
|------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| 29,120     | 0            | 0                | 2            |


✅ No missing cost or category — critical for profitability analysis.

⚠️ Two missing product names: For this analysis, I’ll leave them as-is since they don’t significantly impact overall metrics. However, in a real-world scenario, it would be essential to trace and correct these records—accurate product naming is critical for reporting, inventory management, and customer experience. Ignoring "Unknown Product" entries long-term could skew category analysis or marketing insights.

### Orders Table

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
  SUM(CASE WHEN order_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_order_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN user_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_user_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_status,
  SUM(CASE WHEN gender IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_gender
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.orders`;   
```

| total_rows | missing_order_id | missing_user_id | missing_status | missing_gender |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 124,767    | 0                | 0               | 0              | 0              |

✅ All key fields are complete — strong data integrity.

## 2. Checking for Duplicates

To ensure uniqueness, I checked for duplicate product IDs:

```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.products`
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

✅ No duplicates found — each product is uniquely identified.

I also recommend checking for logical duplicates (e.g., same name and category) after cleaning:

```sql
SELECT name, category, COUNT(*)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.products`
WHERE name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY name, category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Why This Matters

Clean data is the foundation of reliable KPIs. Missing values or duplicates can distort metrics like sales trends, conversion rates, or inventory turnover—especially when visualized in Tableau.

With the dataset now validated, we’re ready to calculate Sales, Profitability, and Customer Experience KPIs in the next posts.
