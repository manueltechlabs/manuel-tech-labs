# Chapter 2: Exploring the theLook eCommerce Database — A Data Analyst’s First Steps

Welcome back to Performance Metrics and Insights: A Data-Driven Analysis of TheLook. In the [first chapter](https://manueltechlabs.com/posts/unlocking-ecommerce-success-a-deep-dive-into-thelook-dataset/), we introduced the theLook eCommerce dataset—a rich, realistic, synthetic dataset perfect for practicing real-world analytics. Now, in this second chapter, I’ll walk you through how I explore an unfamiliar database, just as I would on the job.

This isn’t just about writing queries—it’s about thinking like an analyst: asking the right questions, understanding business logic, and uncovering insights hidden in the schema.

## Step 1: What Tables Are We Working With?

First, I need to know what’s available. A quick INFORMATION_SCHEMA query reveals the structure:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`;
```

| table_name |
|------------|
| users |
| order_items |
| distribution_centers |
| inventory_items |
| products |
| orders |
| events |

✅ 7 core tables—a clean, normalized schema typical of modern eCommerce platforms.

## Step 2: Understand Each Table — One by One

I start with the products table—because if we don’t know what’s being sold, we can’t analyze anything.

### products Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.products` LIMIT 5;   
```

This shows product id, name, category, brand, retail_price, and distribution_center_id. A follow-up query reveals:

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_products,
  COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS num_categories,
  COUNT(DISTINCT brand) AS num_brands
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.products`;
```

| num_products | num_categories | num_brands |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| 29,120       | 26             | 2,756      |

📌 Insight: A highly diversified catalog—2,756 brands across 26 categories. This suggests a focus on variety, possibly including private labels.

### distribution_centers Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.distribution_centers`;
```

|index|id|name|latitude|longitude|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|1|Memphis TN|35\.1174|-89\.9711|
|1|2|Chicago IL|41\.8369|-87\.6847|
|2|3|Houston TX|29\.7604|-95\.3698|
|3|4|Los Angeles CA|34\.05|-118\.25|
|4|5|New Orleans LA|29\.95|-90\.0667|
|5|6|Port Authority of New York/New Jersey NY/NJ|40\.634|-73\.7834|
|6|7|Philadelphia PA|39\.95|-75\.1667|
|7|8|Mobile AL|30\.6944|-88\.0431|
|8|9|Charleston SC|32\.7833|-79\.9333|
|9|10|Savannah GA|32\.0167|-81\.1167|

10 centers across the U.S., including major ports. This layout supports national and international shipping.

### events Table — The Heart of User Behavior

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT event_type FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.events`;
```

| event_type |
|------------|
| home |
| department |
| product |
| cart |
| purchase |
| cancel |

📌 Business Logic Revealed:

- Users start at home.
- Browse by department and product.
- Add to cart.
- purchase or cancel.
- This is the conversion funnel in raw form.

And the uri field? It’s even more telling:

```sql
SELECT event_type, uri 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.events` 
WHERE event_type = 'department' LIMIT 5;   
```

| event_type | uri |
|------------|-----|
| department | /department/women/category/jeans/brand/vigoss |
| department | /department/women/category/pants&capris/brand/... |
| department | /department/women/category/intimates/brand/swe... |
| ... | ...|
| department | /department/men/category/active/brand/columbia |

🔍 The API is hierarchical: /department/\{gender\}/category/\{category\}/brand/\{brand\}. This is gold for funnel analysis and campaign tracking.

### inventory_items — Tracking Stock Lifecycle

```sql
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.inventory_items` LIMIT 5;
```

Key fields: created_at, sold_at, cost, product_distribution_center_id.

### orders and order_items — The Transaction Core

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.orders`;
```

| status |
|--------|
| Cancelled |
| Processing |
| Shipped |
| Complete |
| Returned |

These statuses let us measure delivery performance, return rates, and customer satisfaction.

With shipped_at and delivered_at, we can calculate average delivery time—a key KPI.

### users — Who Are Our Customers?

'''sql
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users` LIMIT 5;
'''

Demographics: age, gender, country, traffic_source.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT traffic_source FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users`;
```

| traffic_source |

| Facebook |
| Search |
| Email |
| Organic |
