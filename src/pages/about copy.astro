    <h1 class='post-title'>About Me</h1>
    <p class='intro-text'>
      Welcome to my digital lab! I'm a software developer who builds robust, scalable applications. My journey from Industrial Engineering and Data Science to Java development gives me a unique perspective: I don't just write code—I build solutions that solve core business problems.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">
      My goal is to translate complex operational needs into clean, efficient, and maintainable software.
    </p>
    <h2 class="post-title">
      My Journey: From Process to Code
    </h2>
    <p class="intro-text">
      My career began in Industrial Engineering, where I optimized supply chains and manufacturing processes using methodologies like Kaizen. I soon discovered that the biggest improvements came from better data and systems. This led me to teach myself SQL and web development, where I spent several years building high-impact reporting and BI solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Key Achievement: I managed a full-scale reporting system migration from a legacy ERP to SAP B1, rebuilding all company reports using SQL and Crystal Reports and migrating KPI systems from MSSQL to HanaSQL.
    </p>
    <h2 class="post-title">
      Deepening the Tech Stack
    </h2>
    <p class="intro-text">
      To build more sophisticated solutions, I pursued a Master's in Data Science, mastering Python, R, and machine learning. This academic rigor, combined with practical experience, allows me to understand the entire data lifecycle, from extraction and analysis to model deployment.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Driven to move from analyzing systems to building them, I immersed myself in full-stack Java development.

      What I'm Working On Now
    </h2>
    <p class="intro-text">
      I'm passionate about continuous learning and building practical tools. My current projects include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Developing a full-featured Warehouse Management System (WMS) using Spring Boot, integrating BI and forecasting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implementing robust automated testing and CI/CD pipelines for my personal projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sharing my learnings on this blog.
