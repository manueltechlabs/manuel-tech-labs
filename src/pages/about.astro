    descriptionItems={["Welcome to my digital lab! I'm a software developer who builds robust, scalable applications. My journey from Industrial Engineering and Data Science to Java development gives me a unique perspective: I don't just write code—I build solutions that solve core business problems.", " My goal is to translate complex operational needs into clean, efficient, and maintainable software."]} />

    <HeadingBlock title="My Journey: From Process to Code"
    descriptionItems={[" My career began in Industrial Engineering, where I optimized supply chains and manufacturing processes using methodologies like Kaizen. I soon discovered that the biggest improvements came from better data and systems. This led me to teach myself SQL and web development, where I spent several years building high-impact reporting and BI solutions.", "Key Achievement: I managed a full-scale reporting system migration from a legacy ERP to SAP B1, rebuilding all company reports using SQL and Crystal Reports and migrating KPI systems from MSSQL to HanaSQL."]}/>
    
    <HeadingBlock title="Deepening the Tech Stack"
    descriptionItems={["To build more sophisticated solutions, I pursued a Master's in Data Science, mastering Python, R, and machine learning. This academic rigor, combined with practical experience, allows me to understand the entire data lifecycle, from extraction and analysis to model deployment.", "Driven to move from analyzing systems to building them, I immersed myself in full-stack Java development."]}/>
